# ALU
– Designed an 8-bit ALU supporting arithmetic, logic, shift, and comparison operations with scalable width.
– Developed a SystemVerilog testbench to validate functionality across multiple input cases.
– Prepared for FPGA implementation on Basys3 by mapping inputs to switches and outputs/flags to LEDs.
